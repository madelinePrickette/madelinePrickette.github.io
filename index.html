    <div class="infobody">
         <p>I am a student from Olathe, Kansas who has attended Johnson County Community College.
           I majored in Digital Audio, and took an introduction course to programming, which led me into 
           the new world of coding. Within that course, I learned JavaScript and I really enjoyed it.
           I was able to create video games out of my imagination, and all of a sudden, my favorite
           hobby was now merging with my newly formed passion for coding.</p>
